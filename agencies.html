		<p id="main">NASA: The United States <br><br> NASA's contributions to the space industry has spanned 6 decades, and has arguably been the most impactful. The organisation has successfully launched more than 200 manned flights, and they are currently working on more than 70 missions.
            most space exploration efforts (in the US) have been led by NASA, including the Skylab space station, a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft named Space Shuttle, and the most popular human spaceflight program, Apollo Moon landing missions. NASA has also build and launched
        multiple rovers on the surface of Mars, each of which has been at the forefront of groundbreaking research.</p><br>
        <p>ESA: The EU <br><br>The European Space Agency has contributed heavily to the advancement of space research. The satellites and equipment developed by ESA have visited different planets in our solar system, including Mars Express, Cassini (developed in collaboration with NASA), which has been orbiting Saturn and its moons since 2004. ESA’s space probe named Rosetta took close pictures of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and sent a lander to the surface.
